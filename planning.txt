//////Program Logic///////
-game object properties
  -gameSpeed
  -gridSize
  -seedDensity
  -pause boolean
  -2d grid array
-game object methods
  -initalization - reads gameSpeed, gridSize, seedDensity, pauseState input boxes
    and stores in properties
  -runSimulation loop
  -store grid to 2d array
  -toggle pause boolean, call runSimulation if unpausing

-page's controls
  -pause button - calls game object's togglePause method
  -gameSpeed, gridSize, seedDensity text input

-on page load
  -write grid to DOM with ID gameTable
  -call initalization method of the game object
  -pass grid to game object's 2d array
  -call the game object's start simulation method

-on game object's runSimulation method being called
  -setInterval to every gameSpeed
    -check for pause state
      -if paused clear the interval and exit
    -call the iteration function
      -write CSS class of "on" to the cells that are set to on
      -advance a generation

-on "new seed" button push
  -read seedDensity input box value and store in game object
  -call game object method to randomize the cells using the stored seedDensity

-on "restart game" button push
  -delete the entire gameTable HTML tag
  -call initalization method of the game object
  -write grid to DOM with ID gameTable
  -call the game object's start simulation method
