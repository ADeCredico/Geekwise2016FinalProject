//////Program Logic///////
-game object constituents
  -game object properties
    -gameSpeed
    -gridSize
    -seedDensity
    -pause boolean - initalize to on
    -2d grid array
  -game object methods
    -initalization - is passed gameSpeed, gridSize, seedDensity, pauseState input boxes
      and stores in properties
    -runSimulation loop
    -nextGeneration runs one generation pass over the grid and kills/creates lives
    -storeTable is passed table and stores in 2d grid array
    -toggle pause boolean, call runSimulation if unpausing

-on game object's runSimulation method being called
  -setInterval with  gameSpeed
    -check for pause state
      -if paused clear the interval and exit
    -call the NextGeneration function
    -write CSS class of "on" to the cells that are set to on

-web page controls
  -pause/play button - calls game object's togglePause method
  -reset game button
  -gameSpeed, gridHeight, gridWidth, seedDensity text inputs

-on page load
  -write grid to DOM with ID gameTable
  -call initalization method of the game object
  -pass grid to game object's 2d array
  -call game object method to randomize the cells using the stored seedDensity
  -call the game object's start simulation method

-on "reset game" button push
  -delete the entire gameTable HTML tag
  -write grid to DOM with ID gameTable
  -call initalization method of the game object
  -pass grid to game object's 2d array
  -call game object method to randomizeCells using the stored seedDensity
  -call the game object's start simulation method
